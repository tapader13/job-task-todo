Displays tasks fetched from MockAPI (<https://67e293c997fc65f53536b0d8.mockapi.io/tasks>).

- Tasks are prioritized and sorted (High â†’ Medium â†’ Low).

- Users can add tasks, specifying a title and priority level.

- Tasks are stored in MockAPI, making them persist even after refresh.

- Users can delete tasks, which triggers an API request and removes the task from Redux state.
